# Contributing to mOUND Unity Plugin

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the mOUND Unity Plugin! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Use issue templates** when available
3. **Provide detailed information**:
   - Unity version
   - Plugin version
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Console logs/error messages

### Suggesting Features
1. **Check existing feature requests** first
2. **Describe the use case** clearly
3. **Explain the benefit** to other users
4. **Consider implementation complexity**

### Code Contributions

#### Before You Start
1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch** from `main`
3. **Discuss major changes** in an issue first

#### Development Setup
1. Clone your fork locally
2. Open in Unity 2021.3 LTS or newer
3. Test with a sample Unity project
4. Follow the [Developer Guide](DEVELOPER.md)

#### Code Standards
- **Follow Unity C# conventions**
- **Use meaningful variable names**
- **Add XML documentation** for public methods
- **Include error handling** for network operations
- **Test thoroughly** before submitting

#### Example Code Style
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Uploads a ZIP file to the mOUND Platform
/// </summary>
/// <param name="zipPath">Path to the ZIP file to upload</param>
/// <returns>Coroutine for the upload operation</returns>
private IEnumerator UploadZipFile(string zipPath)
{
    // Implementation with proper error handling
}
```

#### Commit Guidelines
- **Use conventional commits**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.
- **Write clear messages**: Explain what and why
- **Keep commits focused**: One logical change per commit

Example commit messages:
```
feat: add progress bar for large file uploads
fix: handle network timeout during authentication  
docs: update installation instructions for Unity 2022
```
